If you don't want to specify the type: string for the inputs in the workflow_dispatch section, you can simply remove that line. The type field is optional, and if omitted, GitHub Actions will automatically treat the input as a string by default.

Hereâ€™s your updated workflow_dispatch section without the type: string:

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      branch:
        description: 'Branch to run the workflow on'  # This will appear in the UI
        required: false
        default: 'dev'  # Default branch is set to 'dev'
      environment:
        description: 'Choose the environment (e.g., master, production)'  # This will also appear in the UI
        required: true
        default: 'QA'  # Default environment if no input is provided

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # The runner will be an Ubuntu environment
    environment: ${{ github.event.inputs.environment }}  # Dynamically set the environment based on input

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2  # Checkout the code from the repository

    - name: Display selected branch and environment
      run: |
        echo "Deploying to the ${{ github.event.inputs.environment }} environment"
        echo "Using branch: ${{ github.event.inputs.branch }}"

    - name: Set environment-specific variables and variables
      run: |
        echo "Environment: ${{ github.event.inputs.environment }}"
        echo "Branch: ${{ github.event.inputs.branch }}"
        
        # Save environment variable to file
        echo "Selected Environment: ${{ github.event.inputs.environment }}" >> sample.txt
        echo "Selected Branch: ${{ github.event.inputs.branch }}" >> sample.txt

        # Accessing the FULLNAME from the environment context
        echo "FULLNAME from ${GITHUB_ENV} context: ${{ vars.FULLNAME }}" >> sample.txt
        
    - name: Display the contents of the file
      run: |
        cat sample.txt  # Print the file content to see the values

    - name: Run deployment script
      run: echo "We did the thing!"  # Placeholder for actual deployment or script here
